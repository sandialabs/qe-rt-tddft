Real-time TDDFT in Quantum Espresso.

## 2021 June 5
The Sandia-local implementation of RT-TDDFT in Quantum Espresso is in this repository.
You should be looking at the folder containing v6.7.0 of Quantum Espresso because the other is deprecated but not removed just yet.
Inside of that directory, you will find the standard distribution of QE with instructions on how to install it.
The TDDFT implementation is in that directory, under yet another directory SNL-TDDFT.
Once you've compiled whatever conventional QE packages you want to use, switch into SNL-TDDFT to check that out...
